# A barebones stable diffusion implementation on MNIST
- Implemented as an excercise to gain an intuition as to how stable diffusion works under the hood
- Missing many fatures such as guided diffusion, cross attention etc.
- Written whilst working through the enjoyable hugging face diffusion-models-class https://github.com/huggingface/diffusion-models-class

# Commands
- ```python main.py train --epochs=3```
- ```python main.py inference --n_steps=10```
